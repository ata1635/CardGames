## ‚ô£Ô∏è BlackJack ‚ô£Ô∏è

A simple iteration of BlackJack.
- You and the dealer draw "Hit" cards until you "Stay"
- Whoever has the highest points wins!
- 21 points makes you win automatically
- Whoever exceeds 21 points loses ("Bust")  
  - Cards give points according to their number (**2-9**)  
  - Jack, Queen and King give **10** points  
  - Ace gives **11** points, or **1** if counting 11 would cause a bust
